    about: "Decide on original-style paint or a custom finish, mask machined and bearing surfaces, then refinish the frame, tank, covers and engine cases.",
    why: "A good finish stops rust, but paint or powder in the wrong place (threads, bearing seats, ground points) causes problems during assembly.",
    tips: ["Fix rust and pinholes in the tank before any paint goes on.", "Write down every product you use and its cure time.", "Never blast an engine that still has its internals inside."],

    about: "Install the steering, suspension, wheels, brakes, engine, wiring harness, controls, carburetors and exhaust onto the finished frame.",
